# Salary Calculator
Simple Console Application with a custom file database system, that reads the
Descriptions of some employees, and calculates their salary, extra payments and etc,
based on their monthly salaries, overtimes and the loans that they got from the company;
its actually based on a sample salary model in an imaginary company :)
# Language: C#
# Note:
Program input is through Employees, Overtimes, Loans and Salaries text files,
placed right beside the applications output file.
